#BooleanOperatorsTest
##should_perform_logical_boolean_operations()
###Question 1: What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
Answer: The purpose of this testing is to define expected result of the booleans coming from actual results. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/boolean-type-in-java 
###Question 2: Why the test failed at first?
Answer: Because the expected value is either no value or wrong.
###Question 3: Why you corrected the test that way?
Answer: Boolean analysis		
###Question 4: Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
Answer: None.
